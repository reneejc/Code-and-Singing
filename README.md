Code-and-Singing
================

Do you want to get to know better the technology (and the codes looping behind) that you use everyday? Come sing along, weíll chant with them. 

This workshop will explore the research that Carmichael used in the creation of No.01 1 Chant to Them, including: a history of IBM, cybernetics, incorporation, voice and voice as interface, and the relationship between interface and control. With these ideas, which relate to the workshop on Code Poetry that took place during ccthenrís last project in London last November, we will use singing and song writing as a way to understand coding languages.

We can start to take control of the technologies that we use everyday by learning to understand the - without being experts. And this understanding can stem from a wide variety of interests that extend beyond the screen  - singing is just one possibility.
